# HTML and CSS Project

i chose the website kehler vegtables.  
Here is the link. https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/
it's purpos is to advertize the kehler farm and provide potential customers with information and a way to contact the farm.  
the target audience includes locals and health concious people.  
their message is to go to their farm, buy their produce, and contact them.

## some issues with this website

### accessibility

testing with wave showed me 21 contrast errors, missing alt text, no headings, and there is no language selected.

### lighthouse results

when tested using lighthouse it had a performance score of 31, accessibility 44, best practices 54, and SEO 83. it took 6.9 seconds to load, and had countless errors.

### other things i noticed

the hero and header are merged and take up so much of the screen that i didnt even notice a difference in pages for 5 minutes! the footer is weirdly tall, it takes up way more room than it needs to. the home screen displays an error saying that the photos cannot be displayed. and the code is div soup.

## the look and feel i will be going for

i will be going for a homey, aproachable mood, using similar colours to the original website; dark green(#323F24), light green (#5C8039), white, and black.

some inpiration i've found: https://lentelusfarms.com/ it is a website for a similar buisness, and provides is very effective.
